# Blog-Site
This is  a multi-user blog web application, you can think of it more as a company blog.
I have used some 3rd party open source libraries to make this real django project.
A superuser can create a new post and he can modify it even it is published. You can change the font view of post content as per requirement.
You can even add comments and can decide which comment has to be approved or not.
